# Machine translations of the CBETA corpus

# Versions
Currently, this repository offers two sets of (Chinese to English) machine translated Buddhist texts.

The model that produced the first set ("taisho_by_deepl", ver. 2022-05) was created by [Till Westermann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/till-westermann-23ab3ba3?originalSubdomain=de) with support from [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) (SE Maarweg 165, 50825 Cologne, Germany).

The DeepL set is a complete “translation” of the two largest parts of the [CBETA corpus](https://www.cbeta.org/) (Tn1-n2184,Tn2732-n2920, Xn1-n1671).


The second set ("taisho_by_LinguaeDharmae", ver. 2022-06) is the output of a model called "Linguae Dharmae" (June 2022) created by Sebastian Nehrdich (Bochum).

The Linguae Dharmae set is a complete “translation” of the Taishō part of the [CBETA corpus](https://www.cbeta.org/) (Tn1-n2184,Tn2732-n2920).
